<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
<p>Storage facilities - Storage facilities are likely home to much of your valuable inventory, and thus a prime area for theft. Prevent loss at the hand of both internal and external burglars by mounting security cameras inside and outside your storage facility. Also, make sure to keep your storage facility well-lit for quality recordings and to hinder dubious activity from the beginning.</p>
