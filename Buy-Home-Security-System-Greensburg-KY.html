<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that give access to a home's security app to up to 20 family members. However, shared monitoring isn't a feature readily available from all companies. Be sure to research the company's features or speak with a representative directly if this is a high priority.

We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
