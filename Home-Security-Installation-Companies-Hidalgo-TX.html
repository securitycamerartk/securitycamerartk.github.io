<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, normally via 110VAC power. </p>
