The normal reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing a chance for the harmful opponent to tape-record these codes and use numerous cracking tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can release a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security secrets based on the "design" security key recorded during the network healing.</p>
