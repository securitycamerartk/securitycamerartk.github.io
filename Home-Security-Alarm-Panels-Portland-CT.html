<h3>House Alarm Monitoring in Portland CT</h3>
<p>Unlike conventional burglar alarms, which have a control panel (typically located in the entrance hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensors have actually been activated, wise alarms are controlled from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and informs you if any of the sensing units have been activated, instead of getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and potentially frustrating your neighbours).

And while this is a pretty basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is relatively uncommon in outdoor security cameras.</p>

Although FrontPoint offers a wide range of equipment and home automation items at an affordable rate, the one location where the company especially excels is in DIY installation. </p>
