<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not especially groundbreaking, so we're really advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free strategy alternative. Sure, you get a lower cost if you choose a three-year contract, but because Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment.

Wireless keypads and keychains so you can manage your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
