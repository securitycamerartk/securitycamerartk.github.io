Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is necessary.
