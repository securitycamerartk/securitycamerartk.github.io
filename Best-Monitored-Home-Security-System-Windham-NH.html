<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out mobile phone alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
