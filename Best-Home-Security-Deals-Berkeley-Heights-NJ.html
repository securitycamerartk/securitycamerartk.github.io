<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency.

<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, however we agree with its suggestion that users ought to reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary step. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such incidents. However, after this most current entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we do not think that these issues modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our current suggestion.</p>

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
