<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short description of how thermal cameras work: All objects release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy released by an item is referred to as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it produces. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of identifying small distinctions in temperature level. The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon details about the temperature distinctions.

Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security given that it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
