I have actually dumped my Nest Cams considering that they were bought by Google. Something we all need to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually found trespassers or wild animals. Do you wish to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice. Note that these sirens may violate local noise control laws, so check ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
