<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually set up on the porch by a licensed electrical contractor (who occurs to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send out smartphone signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
