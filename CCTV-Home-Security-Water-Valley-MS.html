<p>Possibly this is no better demonstrated than by means of Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter's comments, at IFSEC International in 2019 Tony highlighted how much had altered since he took on the function in 2014, with the development of facial recognition, drones, body-worn cameras, analytics, GDPR and much more. Modern systems now have extraordinary capabilities", though these have actually produced reasonable misgivings about the risk for personal privacy and possible abuse such capabilities develop.
