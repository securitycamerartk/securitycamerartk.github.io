<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal given that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
