<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
