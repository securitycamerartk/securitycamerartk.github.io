<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the precise very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
