<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to identify it.

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security since it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
