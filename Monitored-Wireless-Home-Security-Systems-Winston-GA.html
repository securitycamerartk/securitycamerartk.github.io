<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If recording video in the dark is a top priority, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
