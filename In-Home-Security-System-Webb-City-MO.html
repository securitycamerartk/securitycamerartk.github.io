<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send out mobile phone signals with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
