By combining LiveWatch DIY security systems with Moni's professional monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security taking on other big names in the industry.

If, nevertheless, burglar alarms are ineffective or unreliable, the drain on police resources from reacting to them might outweigh their benefits.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name.

We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
