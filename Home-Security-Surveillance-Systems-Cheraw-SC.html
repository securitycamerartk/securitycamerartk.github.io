<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
<p>When I eventually entered into the camera controls, I was fairly satisfied. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly self-explanatory. You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes just to let the person being viewed know they're being viewed, and you can pick to tape-record video clips or photos and save them to your clever device on an impulse. </p>
