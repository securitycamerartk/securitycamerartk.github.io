When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends out double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the threat and, if needed, could just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>

<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most highly innovative outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.
