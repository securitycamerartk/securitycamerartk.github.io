The camera can tape-record video in as much as 1080p, which looks perfectly fine on a smart device screen and won't tax your web connection too much.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not especially revolutionary, so we're truly recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year contract, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So select what will be the better offer for you. Go with the contract and gain those savings if you understand you'll stay put for at least 3 years. However if you might upgrade to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best option.</p>

You have actually got two-way audio, you can play melodies simply to let the person being seen understand they're being watched, and you can select to tape-record video clips or images and save them to your clever device on a whim. </p>
