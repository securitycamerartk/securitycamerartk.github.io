<p>This cool smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During screening, we found it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly setting off when motion was spotted. We love that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector.
