<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
