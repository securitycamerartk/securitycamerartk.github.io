<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Property protection gadgets are developed to safeguard particular, tangible assets, such as precious jewelry, paintings, cash boxes, and family treasures. These devices can be equipped with anti-tampering technology to prevent being disarmed. If the item to which the gadget has been attached is moved or disturbed, the sensor will activate an alarm.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively typical. If a property owner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by an area feline, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
