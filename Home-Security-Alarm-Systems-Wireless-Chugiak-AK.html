Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were remarkable in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
