<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face recognition software. The latter enables you to see exactly when a specific person arrives at the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has actually expanded its security range with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also plan to release a wise smoke detector and siren later on this year, that makes this an even much better proposal.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in numerous areas around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android smartphone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint uses a wide range of equipment and home automation products at a reasonable rate, the one area where the company especially excels is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
