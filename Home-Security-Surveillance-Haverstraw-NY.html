<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an offense. Once a zone has actually been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
