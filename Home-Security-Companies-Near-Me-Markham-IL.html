<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
