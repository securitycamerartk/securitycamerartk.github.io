<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that needed expert installation. Pro-installed systems generally cost more, use equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, come with long and usually difficult contracts, and typically count on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they use little benefit. A good example is the Vivint system, which we've reviewed independently and don't suggest for the majority of people.</p>

Like the Arlo Pro 2, the Blink system also comes with a sync module that connects to WiFi instead of utilizing an ethernet cable to attach to your router, making things a bit simpler.
